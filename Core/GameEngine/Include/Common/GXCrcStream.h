// Locate where two machines' lockstep checksums part, from one machine's data.
//
// A replay recorded on the PC client carries that machine's whole-state
// checksum and nothing else: one number per interval. When it disagrees with
// ours, the number says the simulations differ and says nothing about where,
// which is why this port has spent weeks diffing candidate subsystems.
//
// It does not have to be that way. The checksum is built one 32-bit word at a
// time by XferCRC::addCRC, and that step is exactly invertible:
//
//     forward:  crc' = ROL(crc, 1) + word        (mod 2^32)
//     inverse:  crc  = ROR(crc' - word, 1)
//
// So if we keep the words this machine fed in, and the running value after
// each, we can start from the OTHER machine's final number and walk backwards
// through our own words. Wherever the backward walk meets our forward values,
// the two machines agreed from that point to the end -- so the last agreeing
// position is where the difference enters. Labels recorded alongside turn that
// position into "object id 159, 6 words into its contribution".
//
// This reads the PC's number and our own state. It needs no instrumentation on
// the PC, no Windows build, and no second device.
//
// It assumes the two word streams have the same length and differ in one
// region. If the streams are different lengths -- a different object count, a
// module one side does not have -- no position matches, and saying so is itself
// the finding, so report() states that case rather than guessing.

# GeneralsX @feature Android port 23/09/2026 Frame-exact replay comparison with the PC.
#
# A recording carries the logic checksum only every 100 frames (header field C=100), so
# a mismatch says "somewhere in these hundred frames". The replay header's C field is
# the checksum interval the *player* uses, and the PC client compares every checksum
# it computes against the next one queued from the file, pausing at the first mismatch
# with "Frame:N". This tool writes a copy of a replay with C=001 whose checksum records
# are this device's checksums of every frame, taken from a log made with the launcher's
# "Checksum of every frame" switch (engine option -gxCrcEveryFrame, log lines
# "crc every frame N: XXXXXXXX"). Played on the PC, that copy stops at the first frame
# where the PC disagrees with this device.

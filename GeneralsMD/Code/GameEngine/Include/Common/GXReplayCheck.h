// GXReplayCheck.h ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// GeneralsX @feature Android port 23/09/2026 Replay checking without watching.
//
// A replay can only be reproduced by simulating it from frame 0 -- it holds the
// commands, not the state -- so "start at frame 3400" really means "get to 3400
// fast". Two launch options, set by the launcher's Replay check screen and
// combined with the engine's own -replay:
//
//   -gxFastTo <frame>   run the logic without drawing until <frame>, then play
//                       normally; -1 means the whole replay
//   -gxAutoQuit         when the replay ends, or some frames after the first
//                       checksum mismatch, write gx_replay_check_result.txt in
//                       the user-data folder and quit back to the launcher
//   -gxCrcEveryFrame    also compute the logic checksum on every frame and print it
//                       ("crc every frame N: X"). The recording only carries one per
//                       hundred frames; scripts/tooling/replay/rep_crc_every_frame.py
//                       writes these into a copy of the replay (header C=001), and the
//                       PC client, playing that copy, stops at the first frame where it
//                       disagrees with this device
//
// Fast-forward runs extra logic frames between rendered ones, exactly what the
// engine's headless replay simulation does per frame (particles, then logic), so
// the simulation and its checksums are the same as when watching.
